This is a WebhookChatFilter which allows staff member to add a list of blocked words in-game. You can give your staff members "staff.manage" permission through luck perms.
You can do /blockword <word> to block a word from people typing in chat. You can also go through the blocked_words.yml file located in the server's main folder. You can do
/unblockword <word> if you made a mistake. You can also add your discord webhook so whenever someone says something prohibited, it gets logged.
